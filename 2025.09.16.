CPU (Central Processing Unit)

Role: The “brain” of the computer that performs the main arithmetic, logical, and input/output operations.


Key Parts of the CPU

1. Control Unit (CU) – coordinates the work of all components.


2. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) – performs calculations and logical operations.


3. Registers – very fast, small memory used for temporary storage of data and instructions.


RAM (Random Access Memory)

Purpose: Short-term storage of data for quick access by the processor.

Characteristics:

Volatile — data is lost when power is turned off.

The larger the capacity, the higher the system’s performance.



Motherboard

Connects and provides communication between all computer components.

Contains:

CPU

Chipset – manages data exchange between the processor, memory, and devices.

BIOS/UEFI – basic input/output system that starts the computer and loads the operating system.


Data Storage

Purpose: Used to store and preserve software and user data.


Types of Storage Devices

1. Hard Disk Drive (HDD) – magnetic storage with large capacity and lower cost.


2. Solid-State Drive (SSD) – faster, no moving parts, more durable.


3. Optical Drives (CD/DVD) – read and write data on discs.


4. External Drives / USB Flash Drives – portable storage for easy data transfer.
